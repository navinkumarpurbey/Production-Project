# 📊 Predictive Analysis and Visualization for Healthcare Market Trends

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is designed to forecast disease patterns, healthcare spending, and accessibility trends using predictive analytics and machine learning. It delivers a full-stack solution that combines powerful backend models with interactive dashboards for real-time insight delivery.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Forecast future healthcare trends (spending, disease prevalence, accessibility)
* Build predictive ML models: Linear Regression, XGBoost, ARIMA, LSTM
* Develop dynamic dashboards using Power BI and React.js
* Secure admin-user system with real-time logs
* Enable data transparency for both developed and underdeveloped healthcare systems

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, HTML, CSS, TypeScript
* **Backend:** Python, Flask, REST API
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Keras, statsmodels
* **Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (user activity logs)
* **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Render (backend), GitHub Pages

## 📊 Key Features

* Real-time ML-based forecasting
* 10-year trend prediction with ARIMA & LSTM
* Interactive dashboard with disease filters, year, country
* Secure login with JWT and email verification
* Admin dashboard with feedback and user tracking
* Downloadable CSV/PDF reports

## 🧪 Methodology

* CRISP-DM for data mining lifecycle
* Agile (Scrum) project management with weekly sprints
* Continuous integration via Git & GitHub
